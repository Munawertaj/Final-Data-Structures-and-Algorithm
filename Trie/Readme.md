# Trie Data Structure  

## What is a Trie?  
A **Trie**, also known as a **Prefix Tree**, is a tree-like data structure that is used for storing some collection of strings(like words) & performing efficient search operations on them. It is particularly useful when dealing with prefix-based operations.


## Key Properties of Trie:  
- If two strings share a common prefix, they will have the same ancestor node in the Trie.  
- It allows efficient insertion, search, and deletion of words.  
- Tries are commonly used in applications that require prefix-based searching, such as dictionaries and autocomplete features.  


## Time Complexity:  
| Operation  | Time Complexity |  
|------------|----------------|  
| Insertion  | **O(n)** |  
| Searching  | **O(n)** |  
| Deletion   | **O(n)** |  

Where **n** is the length of the word being inserted, searched, or deleted.  

## Applications of Trie  
Tries are widely used in:  
âœ… **Dictionaries** â€“ Storing words for fast lookup  
âœ… **Autocomplete Features** â€“ Predicting words based on prefixes  
âœ… **Spell Checkers** â€“ Identifying misspelled words  
âœ… **Longest Prefix Matching Algorithms** â€“ Used in networking and text processing  

With its structured approach, the Trie data structure provides an optimal solution for prefix-based search operations. ðŸš€
